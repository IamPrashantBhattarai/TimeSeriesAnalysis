        "# Time Series Forecasting\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on previously observed data points that are indexed in time order. This kind of data appears in many real-world applications such as weather prediction, stock price analysis, sales forecasting, traffic monitoring, and healthcare monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of time series forecasting is to model the underlying structure of the data and use it to predict future outcomes. Effective forecasting allows individuals, businesses, and governments to make informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and plan strategically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time series data has a temporal component, i.e. the order and intervals between observations matter. As discussed in the previous sections, this introduces unique challenges such as seasonality, trend, noise, and autocorrelation that must be considered when building forecasting models.\n",

        "## Why Time Series Forecasting\n",
        "Time series forecasting is to anticipate future outcomes based on historical data observed over time. Unlike traditional statistical analysis that often focuses only on static data, time series forecasting also uses the **temporal asepcts** of a process. It can be used across various fields including economics, healthcare, engineering, meteorology, business operations and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Real-Time and Future-Oriented Decision Making\n",
        "Unlike static datasets, time series data captures how variables evolve over time to make proactive decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "- Retailers forecast product demand to manage inventory.\n",
        "- Financial institutions predict stock prices for portfolio management.\n",
        "- Governments project population growth for infrastructure planning\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Identifying and Leveraging Patterns\n",
        "Time series forecasting helps uncover underlying structures such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Trends:** Are values generally increasing or decreasing over time?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Seasonality:** Are there periodic fluctuations like weekend spikes in web traffic?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cyclic behaviors:** Are there economic booms and busts?\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding these, we can find patterns to optimize operations and respond to changes effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Resource Optimization\n",
        "Accurate forecasts enable better budget allocation, staff scheduling, and maintenance planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "- Predicting market ROI\n",
        "- Staff Routines and working hours division\n",
        "- Machine failure forecasting\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Risk Management\n",
        "Forecasting enables anticipation of unfavorable events, allowing for the timly development of mitigation measures.\n",

        "# Single Step and Multi Step Forecasting\n",
        "The nature of time series forecasting may vary depending on the past observations and strategies for the forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Single Step Forecasting\n",
        "Single-step forecasting involves predicting only the next immediate value in a time series. The model is trained to make one prediction at a time, using the most recent historical data available. This method is particularly useful when short-term accuracy is more important than long-term foresight. It is widely adopted in domains where real-time responses are critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Applications\n",
        "- Predicting weather and temperature.\n",
        "- Sensor readings in IoT devices.\n",
        "- Immediate stock price movement predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages\n",
        "- Simple to implement and train.\n",
        "- Less prone to cumulative errors since only one prediction is made.\n",
        "- Faster inference and lower computational complexity.\n",
        "- Suitable for real-time systems and short-term prediction tasks.\n",
        "- Evaluation is straightforward with standard metrics like MAE or RMSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Drawbacks\n",
        "- Does not provide a long-term view or trend.\n",
        "- Requires re-running the model for each subsequent prediction if multiple forecasts are needed.\n",
        "- Not ideal for strategic planning or decision-making that depends on extended forecasts.\n",
        "- Lacks temporal continuity in prediction chains when used repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Multi Step Forecasting\n",
        "Multi-step forecasting involves predicting a sequence of future values over a defined forecast horizon. Unlike single-step models, multi-step approaches generate forecasts for multiple future time points either all at once or through recursive steps. This method is essential for long-term planning and forecasting trends, seasonality, and extended behaviors in data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Applications\n",
        "- 7-day weather forecasts.\n",
        "- Forecasting monthly sales for the next year.\n",
        "- Energy consumption for the next 24 hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages\n",
        "- Provides a broader outlook and future trend insight.\n",
        "- Useful for long-term forecasting and strategic planning.\n",
        "- Can be integrated with planning and decision-making systems.\n",
        "- Enables modeling of temporal dependencies across multiple future steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Drawbacks\n",
        "- More complex model design and longer training time.\n",
        "- **Error propagation:** Small errors in early predictions can snowball over the forecast horizon.\n",
        "- Choosing the right forecast horizon can be difficult and subjective.\n",
        "- Balancing accuracy and horizon length is challenging.\n",
        "- Evaluation is more complex as performance over all predicted time steps needs to be considered.\n",

        "The accuracy and reliability of the time series forecast depends on the choice of appropriate model according to the **data characteristics, practical constraints, and performance expectations**. The main types of models for forecasting include statistical measures, machine learning algorithms and deep learning models, which we will discuss in the next section. In this section, we will discuss the major conditions to be analysed for selecting the correct models for our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Nature of the Data\n",
        "Understanding the underlying patterns in the time series is the most important step for model selection. The data may be **stationary** or may contain trends, seasonality and cyclic patterns. **Abrupt changes or structural breaks**, as well as **time interval and its consistency** in the data also need to be considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Models that assume stationarity (e.g., ARIMA) may not perform well on strongly trending or seasonal data unless such components are removed or modeled separately.\n",

        "### 2. Forecasting Horizon\n",
        "The forecasting horizon - how far ahead the model needs to predict — can significantly influence the choice of model and affect the performance and efficiency of the models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Short-term forecasting** requires high-resolution, immediate accuracy and can often rely on simpler or autoregressive models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Long-term forecasting** must account for trends, seasonality, and uncertainty, often requiring more sophisticated or ensemble methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Complexity vs Interpretability\n",
        "Model complexity is a tradeoff against how easily the model can be understood and explained. Simpler models can be chosen when interpretability or speed is crucial, and complex models are used only when accuracy is crucial over reducing complexity.\n",
        "- **Simple models** (e.g., exponential smoothing) are easier to interpret, faster to compute, and suitable for operational forecasting.\n",
        "- **Complex models** (e.g., deep learning) may yield higher accuracy but are often black-box systems with limited transparency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Data Volume\n",
        "The quantity of historical data available directly affects model performance.\n",
        "- **Large datasets** allow for training high-capacity models with reduced overfitting risk.\n",
        "- **Small datasets** require regularization, simpler models, or data augmentation. In small datasets, enough data may not be available to capture seasonality if it exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Computation and Deployment Needs\n",
        "Forecasting models should align with operational requirements like infrastructure limitations, latency constraints, and deployment environment when choosing a model.\n",
        "- **Real-time systems** require lightweight models with fast inference times.\n",
        "- **Batch systems** (e.g., monthly forecasts) can tolerate slower, more computationally intensive models for better results.\n",
